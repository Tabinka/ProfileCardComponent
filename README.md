## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me with shaping my knowledge about Git and Sass. It was a great project for my first challenge!

Very simple and easy to code. A little bit of a problem for me was positioning background images.

### Continued development

I found out that Flexbox and Grid are very powerful tools, which I wanna focus on even in future challenges.
